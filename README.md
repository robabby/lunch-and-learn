#CSS Lunch & Learn

This project is focused on educating the basics of CSS.  The project includes three pages focused on introducing certain aspects of CSS, and finishes with an example building a navigation bar.

If you would like to launch this project locally, you will need to have [Ruby & Rails](http://railsinstaller.org) installed, along with the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) Gem.

After Ruby & Rails are installed, run `gem install jekyll` in a Command Prompt to install Jekyll for Ruby.  Once installed, head on over to the project in your command prompt/terminal, and then execute a `bundle install` inside the project directory to install a couple of dependancies.
